          <p>Bruce Lee, born Lee Jun-Fan on November 27 1940 in San Francisco, was a renowned martial artist and actor and was one of the biggest pop culture icons of the 20th century.</p>
          <p>Bruce spent his early years in Hong Kong and appeared in 20 films by the age of 18. Despite his acting, Lee was continually getting into trouble due to fighting. One of the biggest changes in his life was when he began to study with Yip Man at the
            age of 16. Lee flourished in the Wing Chun style, but ultimately had to leave Hong Kong due to his street fighting.</p>
          <p>Lee arrived in America at 18. He completed his high school education and enrolled in college. It is here he started teaching others martial arts. In 1964, Lee demonstrated his 'one-inch punch' at the Long Beach International Karate Championships.
            Not long after this, the infamous fight with Wong Jack Man took place. This fight is the reason that Jeet Kune Do was born, as Lee has said that the fight took too long and the techniques were too rigid.</p>
          <p>Lee had some small acting roles in the US, most notably as Kato in The Green Hornet, but ultimately left the US for Hong Kong after he felt his idea for a TV show, Kung Fu, had been stolen. Lee arrived in Hong Kong in 1971, already famous for his
            Kato role. He signed a two picture deal and the first of those, The Big Boss, was released that year. It was a huge success for Lee. Lee would make 4 other movies before his death on July 20 1973.</p>
